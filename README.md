Statistical Quality Control (SQC) is a method used in manufacturing and other industries to ensure that products or processes meet specified quality standards. It applies statistical techniques to monitor and control processes, aiming to reduce variability and maintain consistency in output.

Key components of SQC include:

1. **Control Charts**: Tools like X-bar, R, and S charts are used to monitor process behavior over time, identifying variations that may indicate problems.
2. **Process Capability Analysis**: This assesses whether a process can produce products within specified limits.
3. **Acceptance Sampling**: Techniques for inspecting a sample of products to determine if a batch meets quality standards.

By identifying and correcting sources of variation, SQC helps maintain product quality, reduce waste, and enhance efficiency.
